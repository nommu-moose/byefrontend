## Intro

A django package which intends to allow developers to minimise their exposure to frontend programming to their heart's content.
This can be done entirely, through hierarchical Python site-structure definition objects/widgets,
individually for specific elements needed within the traditional django templating HTML language,
or a mix of the two to any degree.

The package also includes some closely tied other functionality for the frontend (e.g. secret handling both for front and backend)

## Roadmap

See the [**roadmap**](ROADMAP.md) for upcoming features and planned improvements.
